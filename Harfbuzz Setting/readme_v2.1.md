The new option added to the script allows users to choose whether or not to recompose the text frames after modifying the Harfbuzz settings. Here's a simple explanation:

- **After setting Harfbuzz**: The script asks if you want to recompose (refresh) the text frames in the document.
- **If you choose "Yes"**: The script will recompose all text frames, ensuring any changes are applied.
- **If you choose "No"**: The script will display a message saying, "Recompose process canceled. No changes were made," and no further action will be taken.

This gives users the flexibility to decide if they want to proceed with recomposing the text frames or skip that step.
